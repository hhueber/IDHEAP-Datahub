  <h2>Project background</h2>
  <p class="text-start">
    Launched in 1988 by Prof. Andreas Ladner, the Swiss Municipal Monitoring survey observes the evolution and
    development of Swiss municipalities by focusing on key themes such as municipal performance, local finances,
    institutional reforms, inter-municipal collaboration and political issues. This initiative, in collaboration with
    ZHAW, is a valuable and comprehensive resource for associations, public institutions, academics and the general
    public, providing essential data to inform decision-making and guide local policies.
  </p>

  <p class="text-start">
    In 2023, Prof. Markus Hinterleitner and Prof. Olivier Schöni took over, ensuring the continuity of this fundamental
    research. The IDHEAP Data Hub aims to preserve and enhance the legacy of the late Prof. Ladner by using information
    technology to capitalise on decades of research and data on the development of Swiss municipalities.
  </p>
  <h2>Développement</h2>
  <p class="text-start">
    The code for the web application is being developed by Hugo Hueber, the DCSR research engineer dedicated to the FDCA, in
    collaboration with Matthieu Jacques, Master's student in Data Science at EPFL.
  </p>

  <p class="text-start">
    The code is distributed under the MIT licence. You can view and download it from our GitHub repository.
